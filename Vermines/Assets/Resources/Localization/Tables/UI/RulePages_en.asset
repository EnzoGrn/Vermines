      take turns playing in a clockwise\ndirection. Their aim is to acquire\n\u201CPartisan\u201D
      and \u201CObject\u201D cards in order to build\na deck. To do this, they must
      use\neloquence (the game's currency), which will be earned from the\ndifferent
      cards acquired during the game. Each\n\u201CPartisan\u201D card has a soul
      value and can, after\nbeing played, be sacrificed to win souls\n(victory points).
      The first player to\nreach 100 souls wins the game."

    m_Localized: When the final soul vibrated, we, the Crickets, echoed our strident
      song across the ruins. Once ruled by bees, the entire kingdom bowed to our
      sacred dissonance. The Whistling God rose behind the city, and His whisper
      now forever drowns out the silence of the old kings.

    m_Localized: 'We gathered every rotten soul, patiently, mercilessly. The bees
      ruled, but they were only a golden mask over a rotting carcass. We, the Flies,
      tore the veil. Our Crawling God rose behind the ashes, and now all breathe
      in the stench of truth.

    m_Localized: The peoples of the kingdom followed the bees, believing their light
      eternal. But we, the Beetles, rolled the souls to the edge of the abyss. From
      the broken earth, our God rose, gigantic and silent. The old order is crushed.
      A new era begins, carved in sacred mud.

    m_Localized: Beneath the bright colors burned a smoldering faith. We, the Ladybugs,
      lived long under the golden reign of the bees. But the waiting is over. The
      sky split open, revealing our God with fractal wings. In the flames, justice
      was done. And the future is now painted in red.
